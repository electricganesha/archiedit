# ArchiEdit
## Concept
ArchiEdit is an architectonic space visualizer and editor. With ArchiEdit, you could import a certain architectural model, and - in real-time - change the disposition of furniture, decoration elements like wallpaper and floor and even fiddle with the illumination. All of this in a fairly good quality render, with many environmental features like reflections, refractions, real-time lighting among others. We intend to develop ArchiEdit to support collaborative editing, meaning that more than one person can be modifying the disposition of furniture, decoration and lighting, simultaneously, and observe the modifications in real-time providing faster feedback to the client. This project is developed in WebGL, which is browser compatible, and allows for multi-platform compatibility.

## Tech
ArchiEdit was developed in HTML/CSS/Javascript using the [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) framework.
